As well as his many triumphs, we will also explore the challenges he faced, from the death of his first wife and son to the initial rejection he faced as an author.&nbsp;</p> <p>We will also look beyond Sherlock to Doyle’s other great works including his fantasy and science fiction novels and hear how one of his most famous, <i>The Lost World</i>, part-inspired Michael Crichton’s book of the same name, which became the successful Jurassic Park film franchise.</p>","title":"The Real Sherlock: An Audible Original","titleShort":"The Real Sherlock"},{"added":286,"asin":"B08BDQ36W5","authors":[{"name":"Marie Benedict","url":"B01EX8MYO4"}],"blurb":"The tide is turning against the colonists in the Revolutionary War, and 18-year-old Elizabeth Morris cannot sit by idly....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Historical Fiction","url":"18574482011"}],"cover":"51mh9pHgpML","format":"Original Recording Audiobook","language":"English","length":"2h 7m","narrators":[{"name":"Emily Rankin"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B08C3XGN8L","authors":"Caroline Overington","cover":"51UDWvzOqeL","length":"4 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"Aimee Horne","subHeading":"An Audible Original Novella","title":"The Cuckoo's Cry"},{"asin":"B07SV4T7K7","authors":"Colin Brake, Patrick Chapman, Richard Hollingham, and others","cover":"51ll1lebmWL","length":"9 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Kate Mulgrew","subHeading":"An Audible Original","title":"The Space Race"},{"asin":"B07RT12V4Q","authors":"Carla Grauls","cover":"514CDvM4UoL","length":"1 hr and 28 mins","narrators":"Raúl Castillo, Nana Mensah, Piper Goodeve","title":"Life Ever After"},{"asin":"B0842XRT7P","authors":"Louis Moore, The Great Courses","cover":"51pgZWQepWL","length":"4 hrs and 19 mins","narrators":"Louis Moore","title":"African-American Athletes Who Made History"},{"asin":"B08DDC8Y8F","authors":"Jesse Eisenberg","cover":"518x9ZiVZbL","length":"5 hrs and 17 mins","narrators":"Kaitlyn Dever, Jesse Eisenberg, Finn Wolfhard","title":"When You Finish Saving the World"},{"asin":"B085F3F6CX","authors":"Chris Grabenstein","cover":"51GKoszPFmL","length":"3 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Mark Sanderlin, Elizabeth Hess, Oliver Wyman, and others","title":"Stuck"},{"asin":"B089T5SW3N","authors":"Dan Rather","cover":"51NK159FbkL","length":"1 hr and 24 mins","narrators":"Dan Rather","title":"Dan Rather: Stories of a Lifetime"},{"asin":"B08DDJ56J2","authors":"Joan Didion","cover":"513oKbpMTgL","length":"1 hr and 28 mins","narrators":"Vanessa Redgrave","title":"The Year of Magical Thinking"},{"asin":"B0883GHNZQ","authors":"Harvey Fierstein","cover":"51Hhvqc6SML","length":"1 hr and 13 mins","narrators":"Harvey Fierstein","title":"Bella Bella"},{"asin":"B08DG7X16V","authors":"Common, Awoye Timpo, NSangou Njikam","cover":"516mu-GabiL","length":"1 hr and 21 mins","narrators":"Common","subHeading":"A Journey Through Lyrics & Life","title":"Bluebird Memories"},{"asin":"B08DDD5V8J","authors":"Sanjay Gupta MD","cover":"51sWmdvLSzL","length":"46 mins","narrators":"Dr. Sanjay Gupta","subHeading":"Raising Kids During a Pandemic","title":"Childhood, Interrupted"},{"asin":"B088FG552H","authors":"Roshani Chokshi","cover":"51I5GD+LgIL","length":"3 hrs and 26 mins","narrators":"Rebecca Gibel, Shiromi Arserio, Vikas Adam","subHeading":"A Novella","title":"Once More upon a Time"},{"asin":"B07X1TGC2Z","authors":"Rich Cohen","cover":"51Ai-zC5tnL","length":"2 hrs and 7 mins","narrators":"Rich Cohen","title":"Herbie"},{"asin":"B086WP794Z","authors":"Neil Gaiman, Dirk Maggs","cover":"61CEI+8TpdL","length":"10 hrs and 54 mins","narrators":"Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, and others","title":"The Sandman"},{"asin":"1549118870","authors":"James Patterson, Brendan DuBois -

Jackson's gift for characterizations shines - she brings out the humor and heroism in Spensa's young classmates and friends (and the neurotic spaceship MBOT), along with the pain and perseverance of the generations that came before them. This is a high-octane futuristic narrative of hope, sacrifice, and courage, and a fast pace speaks to the rising urgency as war rages above the planet. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award.\" (<i>AudioFile</i> magazine)</p> <p>From Brandon Sanderson, the number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the Reckoners series, <i>Words of Radiance</i>, and the internationally best-selling Mistborn series, comes the first book in an epic new series about a girl who dreams of becoming a pilot in a dangerous world at war for humanity's future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Spensa's world has been under attack for decades. Now pilots are the heroes of what's left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa's dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father's - a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa's chances of attending flight school at slim to none.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>No one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.</p>","title":"Skyward","titleShort":"Skyward"},{"added":232,"asin":"B0085ESQRW","authors":[{"name":"N.

Experience an enthralling performance featuring a cast of rising Broadway stars who join actress and author Alexandra Silber in celebrating the Audible release of<i> After Anatevka</i>, the sweeping historical novel she wrote about Tevye’s second-eldest daughter, Hodel. Silber’s fascination with Hodel began when she played her in a production of <i>Fiddler</i> in London’s West End. Actors often write a backstory for the characters they play so they can fully imagine and embody them onstage. But Silber was more interested in Hodel’s fate than her history. “I had never played a character who felt so much like me,” she says. “I felt responsible for what happened to her after she boards the train to Siberia to join her revolutionary fiancé Perchik.”</p> <p>Originally commissioned by Symphony Space, a form of this concert was produced in March 2017. <i>After Anatevka Live</i> brings to life dramatic excerpts from Silber’s novel with five original songs by contemporary composer and lyricist teams, plus two much-loved songs from <i>Fiddler</i> and one gem that was cut from the final song book. Directed by Carolyn Cantor with musical direction by Ben Moss and an introduction from Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning <i>Fiddler</i> lyricist Sheldon Harnick, this is a charming and magical event for any lover of musical theater.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Cover art photo by Michael Kushner</i>&nbsp;</p>","title":"After Anatevka: Live","titleShort":"After Anatevka: Live"},{"added":230,"asin":"B007ZEAEDC","authors":[{"name":"N.

The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; all the members of the second expedition committed suicide; the third expedition died in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another; the members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within months of their return, all had died of aggressive cancer.</p> <p>This is the twelfth expedition.</p> <p>Their group is made up of four women: An anthropologist, a surveyor, a psychologist - the de facto leader - and a biologist, who is our narrator. Their mission is to map the terrain and collect specimens; to record all their observations, scientific and otherwise, of their surroundings and of one another; and, above all, to avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.</p> <p>They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers - they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding - but it's the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.</p> <p>Cover artwork ©Paramount Pictures.

Betrayed. Dead. Despite his misgivings, he partnered with another former CEO to overthrow Syndic forces. Now, with an enigma fleet menacing their hard-earned independence, he can ill afford to trust her - or lose her support. </p> <p>President Gwen Iceni believes Midway is humanity’s defense against the enigmas. Syndicate training taught her self-preservation in a crisis, yet she’s determined to fight for the star system’s fate…even if it means joining forces with Drakon - and an officer of the hated Alliance. </p> <p>Their plan places the Midway flotilla at great risk in hopes of greater reward: recruiting the personnel necessary to man warships against the enigmas. But before facing the alien advance, Drakon and Iceni must survive hidden dangers closer to home: all-too-human threats that could jeopardize Midway’s freedom…and their own lives.</p>","title":"Perilous Shield: The Lost Stars, Book 2","titleShort":"Perilous Shield"},{"added":157,"asin":"B009D0482O","authors":[{"name":"Jack Campbell","url":"B001H6W4PU"}],"blurb":"The New York Times best-selling author puts the Alliance fleet’s enemy in the spotlight as the people of the Syndicate Worlds attempt to rebuild their lives......","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"61yFEoAaF2L","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"12h 51m","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"Marc Vietor"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B01N2L8CEE","authors":"B.

Any ship that lands there must stay or be destroyed—leaving Geary to face the most profound moral dilemma of his life.</p> <p>To make matters worse, strains on the Alliance are growing as the Syndics continue to meddle. Geary is ordered to take a small force to the border of Syndic space. But what he finds there is a danger much greater than anyone expected: A mysterious threat that could finally force the Alliance to its knees.</p> <p>As Geary spearheads a desperate battle to protect the Alliance against a shrewd and powerful enemy, he’s left with just one question: Who are they?</p>","title":"Steadfast: The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier, Book 4","titleShort":"Steadfast"},{"added":148,"asin":"B00CJIEIWC","authors":[{"name":"Jack Campbell","url":"B001H6W4PU"}],"blurb":"Admiral Geary's First Fleet of the Alliance has survived the journey deep into unexplored interstellar space, a voyage that led to the discovery of new alien species....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"51fnjFX7FcL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"13h 41m","narrators":[{"name":"Christian Rummel"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1774246325","authors":"Craig Alanson","cover":"51YT5FJjKOL","length":"19 hrs and 18 mins","narrators":"R.C.

Aboard the <i>Never Land</i> is a trunk that holds a magical substance with the power to change the fate of the world - just a sprinkle and wounds heal; just a dusting and people can fly. Towering seas and a violent storm are the backdrop for battles at sea. Bone-crushing waves eventually land our characters on Mollusk Island - where the action really heats up.</p> <p><i>Peter and the Starcatchers</i> is brimming with richly developed characters, from the scary but somehow familiar Black Stache and the ferocious Mister Grin to the sweet but sophisticated Molly and the fearless Peter.</p>","title":"Peter and the Starcatchers: The Starcatchers, Book 1","titleShort":"Peter and the Starcatchers"},{"added":131,"asin":"B00W47RCNK","authors":[{"name":"Jack Campbell","url":"B001H6W4PU"}],"blurb":"Trapped within the dead city of Marandur, Master Mechanic Mari and Mage Alain must escape both merciless barbarians and the pitiless Imperial Legion....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"61zu5Ll9KNL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"12h 37m ","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"MacLeod Andrews"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B01E4HGAJO","authors":"Larry Correia","cover":"61J8RZUNMsL","length":"9 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"Ray Porter","subHeading":"Book Two of The Malcontents","title":"Into the Wild"},{"asin":"B08XY5GWTJ","authors":"E.

Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors.

There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.</p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.</p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.</p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:</p> <p>Life before death.</p> <p>Strength before weakness.</p> <p>Journey before destination.</p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.</p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p>The Cosmere</p> <p>The Stormlight Archive:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer (Novella)</i></li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> </ul> <p>Collection:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>","title":"The Way of Kings: The Stormlight Archive, Book 1","titleShort":"The Way of Kings"},{"added":128,"asin":"B005ZUI3OA","authors":[{"name":"Brandon Sanderson","url":"B001IGFHW6"}],"blurb":"Three hundred years after the events of the Mistborn trilogy, Scadrial is now on the verge of modernity.

Or so he thinks, until he learns the hard way that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of the city can be even more dangerous than the dusty plains of the Roughs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere</i></li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive</i></li> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer </i>(Novella)</li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> <li><i>Collection</i></li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity </i></li> </ul>","title":"The Alloy of Law: A Mistborn Novel","titleShort":"The Alloy of Law"},{"added":127,"asin":"B002VA9IKK","authors":[{"name":"Brandon Sanderson","url":"B001IGFHW6"}],"blurb":"To end the Final Empire and restore freedom, Vin killed the Lord Ruler.

Humanity appears to be doomed.&nbsp;</p> <p>Having escaped death at the climax of <i>The Well of Ascension</i> only by becoming a Mistborn himself, Emperor Elend Venture hopes to find clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that will allow him to save the world. Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well. Ruin wants to end the world, and its near omniscience and ability to warp reality make stopping it seem impossible. She can't even discuss it with Elend, lest Ruin learn their plans!&nbsp;</p> <p>The conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy fulfills all the promise of the first two books. Revelations abound, connections rooted in early chapters of the series click into place, and surprises, as satisfying as they are stunning, blossom like fireworks to dazzle and delight. It all leads up to a finale unmatched for originality and audacity that will leave listeners shaking their heads in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Other Tor books by

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.&nbsp;</p> <p>This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson</p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere</i></li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive</i></li> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer </i>(Novella)</li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> <li><i>Collection</i></li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels</p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson</p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity&nbsp;</i></li> </ul>","title":"The Final Empire: Mistborn Book 1","titleShort":"The Final Empire"},{"added":123,"asin":"B00Q7A5XTU","authors":[{"name":"Jack Campbell","url":"B001H6W4PU"}],"blurb":"Someone wants to kill Mari, a young steam mechanic in the guild that controls all technology....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"61zTu2Dwr6L","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"13h 24m ","narrators":[{"name":"MacLeod Andrews"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B08WLP3THD","authors":"James Haddock","cover":"51K+EvSxFDL","length":"9 hrs and 25 mins","narrators":"Daniel Wisniewski","title":"Mage Throne Prophecy"},{"asin":"B08XY5GWTJ","authors":"E.

Since Homer first sang of the wrath of Achilles and the ancient Sumerians set down their tales of Gilgamesh, warriors, soldiers, and fighters have fascinated us; they are a part of every culture, every literary tradition, every genre. <i>All Quiet on the Western Front, From Here to Eternity</i>, and <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> have become part of our literary canon, taught in classrooms all around the country and the world. </p> <p>Our contributors make up an all-star lineup of award-winning and best-selling writers, representing a dozen different publishers and as many genres. We asked each of them for the same thing: a story about a warrior. Some chose to write in the genre they’re best known for. Some decided to try something different. You will find warriors of every shape, size, and color here, warriors from every epoch of human history, from yesterday and today and tomorrow, and from worlds that never were. Some of the stories will make you sad, some will make you laugh, and many will keep you on the edge of your seat. </p> <p>Every story in this volume appears here for the first time. Included are: a long novella from the world of his Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, a new tale of “Lord John” by Diana Gabaldon, an “Emberverse” story by S. M. Stirling, a “Forever Peace” story by Joe Haldeman, and a long tale of humanity at bay by David Weber. Also present are original stories by David Ball, Peter S. Beagle, Lawrence Block, Gardner Dozois, Robin Hobb, Cecelia Holland, Joe R. Lansdale, David Morrell, Naomi Novik, James Rollins, Steven Saylor, Robert Silverberg, Carrie Vaughn, Howard Waldrop, and Tad Williams. </p> <p> Many of these writers are best sellers.

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut - young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs?&nbsp;</p> <p>But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long.

War looms on the horizon as 11-year-old Nickie and her aunt travel to the small town of Yonwood, North Carolina. There, one of the town's respected citizens has had a terrible vision of fire and destruction. Her garbled words are taken as prophetic instruction on how to avoid the coming disaster.

As a new and profound love enfolds him, questions emerge that propel him deeper into his mysterious new world: questions of why and how he has been given this gift; of its true nature and the curious but satisfying pull towards goodness; of the profound realization that there may be others like him who are watching - guardian creatures who have existed throughout time who possess ancient secrets and alchemical knowledge. And throughout it all, the search for salvation for a soul tormented by a new realm of temptations, and the fraught, exhilarating journey, still to come, of being and becoming, fully, both wolf and man. </p>","title":"The Wolf Gift: The Wolf Gift Chronicles (1)","titleShort":"The Wolf Gift"},{"added":34,"asin":"B002V8MMPU","authors":[{"name":"Jim Butcher","url":"B001H6U718"}],"blurb":"Something is stirring up angry apparitions all over town.
